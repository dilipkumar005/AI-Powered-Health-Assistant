step 1: python -m venv myenv

step 2: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process

step 3:  .\myenv\Scripts\activate


python -m venv myenv:

    This creates a new Python virtual environment named myenv in the current directory.
    python -m venv is a built-in Python module used to create isolated environments, allowing you to install packages without affecting the global Python installation.
    The myenv folder will contain the necessary directories and files for the virtual environment.

.\myenv\Scripts\activate:

    This command activates the virtual environment in Windows using PowerShell or Command Prompt.
    .\myenv\Scripts\activate will modify the environment variables for the current session, so Python and pip will use the versions from the virtual environment instead of the system-wide Python installation.
    Once activated, you'll see the environment name (myenv) in the prompt, indicating you're working inside the virtual environment.

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process:

    This command is used in PowerShell to modify the script execution policy, allowing PowerShell to run scripts, including the activate script of the virtual environment.
    RemoteSigned means that PowerShell will allow locally created scripts to run, but scripts downloaded from the internet will need to be signed by a trusted publisher.
    -Scope Process limits the policy change to the current PowerShell session (it doesn't permanently modify the policy).
