# AI-Powered Health Assistant Chatbot
This project is an AI-powered health assistant chatbot designed to provide personalized healthcare advice, answer medical queries, and offer wellness guidance using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. It leverages NLP to interpret and respond to users' health-related queries with accuracy, providing a more dynamic and interactive healthcare experience.


## Key Features:
- **Personalized Medical Advice**: Offers health recommendations based on user-specific data (such as past interactions and preferences) to ensure more accurate and relevant responses.
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Capable of managing ongoing dialogues with users, maintaining context over multiple exchanges to handle complex or evolving queries.
- **Real-Time Feedback Mechanism**: Users can provide feedback on chatbot responses to continuously improve its performance.
- **Knowledge Base**: Includes a wide range of information on common medical conditions, treatments, symptoms, medications, and general wellness.
- **Multi-Lingual Support**: The chatbot can interact with users in various languages, expanding its accessibility to global users.
- **Adaptability and Learning**: Uses reinforcement learning to adapt over time based on user feedback, improving the chatbot’s accuracy and responsiveness as it learns from real-world interactions.

## Technologies Used:

1. **Python**
- The core programming language for developing the chatbot. Python’s simplicity and versatility make it ideal for building AI-based applications.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries**
- **SpaCy**: Used for advanced NLP tasks such as tokenization, named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing.
- **NLTK**: A toolkit for performing basic NLP tasks like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: A library for leveraging pre-trained models like BERT, GPT-3, and other transformer-based models, which enable the chatbot to understand and generate human-like responses.
3. **Machine Learning Frameworks**
- **TensorFlow**: Used for building deep learning models, particularly for training neural networks to understand user queries and generate responses.
- **PyTorch**: An alternative deep learning framework used for training and fine-tuning transformer-based models like BERT and GPT-3.
4. **Pre-Trained AI Models**
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A pre-trained NLP model designed to understand the context of words in a sentence, which helps the chatbot process complex user inputs more effectively.
- **GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3)**: A state-of-the-art model developed by OpenAI for generating human-like text responses based on a given prompt, allowing for more dynamic and engaging conversations.
mBERT (Multilingual BERT) for supporting multiple languages.
5. **APIs & Databases**
- **PubMed and UpToDate**: Medical databases integrated into the system to provide reliable, up-to-date medical information for the chatbot to answer health-related queries.
- **Health APIs**: External APIs that can provide real-time data such as symptom checkers, drug interactions, and medical updates.
6. **Web Frameworks**
- **Flask or FastAPI**: Web frameworks used for deploying the chatbot as a web service, allowing users to interact with the assistant via web browsers or mobile apps.
7. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**: Used to allow the chatbot to learn from user feedback and improve its responses over time, ensuring better accuracy and user satisfaction.
8. **Cloud Computing (Optional)**
- Cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure are used for hosting the application, scaling the backend infrastructure, and ensuring high availability.
9. **Version Control**
- **Git**: A distributed version control system to manage the source code and track changes during the development process.


## Features
- Personalized Responses: Tailors health advice based on user interactions and medical history (with user consent).
- Multi-turn Conversations: Handles complex, multi-turn dialogues, disambiguating unclear queries to provide accurate responses.
- Real-time Feedback: Allows users to provide feedback on responses to improve system accuracy.
- Knowledge Base: Contains medical information on common health conditions, symptoms, treatments, and wellness tips.
- Multi-Lingual Support: Supports users in various languages to make healthcare accessible worldwide.
- Adaptability: Uses machine learning techniques to learn from interactions and improve over time.

# Installation
## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dilipkumar005/AI-Powered-Health-Assistant.git
```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
```bash 
cd AI-Health-Assistant-Chatbot
```
3. **Install Required Dependencies**

Install the necessary packages using [pip]:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Set Up the NLP Model**

You can choose between various pre-trained models like GPT-3, BERT, or other transformer-based models. Make sure you have access to APIs for GPT-3 or similar services. For models like BERT, you can load them directly from the Hugging Face library.

# Usage
## Running the Chatbot
1. **Start the Chatbot**

To run the chatbot, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```
The chatbot will start and await user inputs. It will respond with personalized health advice based on the input provided.

2. **Interacting with the Chatbot**

Once the chatbot is running, you can enter health-related questions. The chatbot will try to answer queries such as:

- "What should I do if I have a headache?"
- "Can you help me with weight loss tips?"
- "What are the symptoms of flu?"
- "Do I need a doctor for this symptom?"
The chatbot will attempt to provide relevant and accurate information.

## Feedback System

After each response, users can rate the chatbot's answers for quality or provide feedback. This feedback is collected for improving the chatbot's performance in future interactions.

## Configurations
You can modify certain configurations in the config.py file, such as:

- **User Profiling**: Enable or disable the storage of user health data.
- **Language Preferences**: Set the default language for the chatbot.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**: The main programming language used for the development of the chatbot.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: For implementing machine learning models such as BERT or GPT.
- **NLTK / SpaCy**: Used for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: For using pre-trained models like BERT, GPT-3.
- **Flask / FastAPI**: For deploying the chatbot as a web service (optional).

## Future Improvements
1. **Integration of Advanced Models**: Incorporating models like GPT-3 or BERT to enhance the chatbot’s ability to handle more complex queries.
2. **Dynamic Learning**: Implementing Reinforcement Learning to enable the chatbot to improve based on user feedback over time.
3. **Expanded Knowledge Base**: Integrating additional sources like PubMed or UpToDate for more accurate and diverse medical data.
4. **Multi-Lingual Support**: Extending support for multiple languages to reach a wider audience.
5. **Real-Time Feedback Mechanism**: Enhancing the feedback system to better refine chatbot responses and enhance user trust.
